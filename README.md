# meta-remote-estei

This Yocto layer is to make your Raspberry Pi 0 W a Wifi remote control. It is a part of a larger project with a robotic car and a Wifi sever between those.

There is a card with buttons to plug over Raspberry Pi.

Fabrication files and a document about this project [fr] will come soon.
